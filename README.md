# Weather App

Weather App built with React and OpenWeatherMap API

Check out the [deployed site](https://patryk-kilian.github.io/weather-app-challenge/)

## Running locally

You need to get ApiKey from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)
At the root of your project create an .env.local and fill it with this variables:

```bash

REACT_APP_BASE_API_URL=<apiUrl(https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5)>
REACT_APP_API_KEY=<apiKey>

```

Then run <code>npm i</code> and <code>npm start</code> to see this app in action.
